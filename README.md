LHS|Campaign
============
LHS Campaign is a simple website to help voters in the Lynbrook High class officer elections mash up profile and cover photos. It also provides a great place to compare the basic campaign promises of the candidates, and make an informed decision about who to vote for.

LHS|Campaign was developed by Adhiv (designer), Will (manager), and Matthew (developer). Contact us at support@lhscampaign.com for more info.

I'm a voter, what does this do for me?
======================================
Once we launch, you'll get to look over the campaign summaries of different candidates, pick the ones you plan on voting for, and mash their images together to form a profile picture or cover photo ready for upload to Facebook or other social accounts.

I'm a candidate, what does this do for me?
==========================================
You'll be able to share your campaign summary with a large number of voters, as well as getting free publicity through their profile pictures create through LHS|Campaign.

Sounds great, where do I sign up?
=================================
You can sign up now at [lhscampaign.com](http://lhscampaign.com), but be warned that we're not completely done with it yet.

Why open source?
================
First and foremost, we'd like to repay at least some of the karma we've benefited from through other open source project. We also recognize that having two candidates (Will and Adhiv) running in the next election working on the site introduces a conflict of interests, and would like to assure people that there's no bias in the order candidates are represented on the site.

I have some questions, who can I contact?
=========================================
You can send any questions to support@lhscampaign.com, or, for questions specifically about the code, feel free to email me at matthewsot@outlook.com
